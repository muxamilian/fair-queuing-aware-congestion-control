	abstract = {Low delay is an explicit requirement for applications such as cloud gaming and video conferencing. Delay-based congestion control can achieve the same throughput but significantly smaller delay than loss-based one and is thus ideal for these applications. However, when a delay- and a loss-based flow compete for a bottleneck, the loss-based one can monopolize all the bandwidth and starve the delay-based one. Fair queuing at the bottleneck link solves this problem by assigning an equal share of the available bandwidth to each flow. However, so far no end host based algorithm to detect fair queuing exists. Our contribution is the development of an algorithm that detects fair queuing at flow startup and chooses delay-based congestion control if there is fair queuing. Otherwise, loss-based congestion control can be used as a backup option. Results show that our algorithm reliably detects fair queuing and can achieve low delay and high throughput in case fair queuing is detected.},

	abstract = {BBR is a new congestion control algorithm (CCA) deployed for Chromium QUIC and the Linux kernel. As the default CCA for YouTube (which commands 11+\% of Internet traffic), BBR has rapidly become a major player in Internet congestion control. BBR’s fairness or friendliness to other connections has recently come under scrutiny as measurements from multiple research groups have shown undesirable outcomes when BBR competes with traditional CCAs. One such outcome is a fixed, 40\% proportion of link capacity consumed by a single BBR flow when competing with as many as 16 loss-based algorithms like Cubic or Reno. In this short paper, we provide the first model capturing BBR’s behavior in competition with loss-based CCAs. Our model is coupled with practical experiments to validate its implications. The key lesson is this: under competition, BBR becomes window-limited by its ‘in-flight cap’ which then determines BBR’s bandwidth consumption. By modeling the value of BBR’s in-flight cap under varying network conditions, we can predict BBR’s throughput when competing against Cubic flows with a median error of 5\%, and against Reno with a median of 8\%.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces Nimbus, a robust technique to detect whether the cross traffic competing with a flow is "elastic", and shows that this elasticity detector improves congestion control. If cross traffic is inelastic, then a sender can control queueing delays while achieving high throughput, but in the presence of elastic traffic, it may lose throughput if it attempts to control packet delay. To estimate elasticity, Nimbus modulates the flow's sending rate with sinusoidal pulses that create small traffic fluctuations at the bottleneck link, and measures the frequency response of the rate of the cross traffic. Our results on emulated and real-world paths show that congestion control using elasticity detection achieves throughput comparable to Cubic, but with delays that are 50-70 ms lower when cross traffic is inelastic. Nimbus detects the nature of the cross traffic more accurately than Copa, and is usable as a building block by other end-to-end algorithms.},

Most prior work on congestion in datagram systems focuses on buffer management. In this memo the case of a packet switch with infinite storage is considered. Such a packet switch can never run out of buffers. It can, however, still become congested. The meaning of congestion in an infinite-storage system is explored. An unexpected result is found that shows a datagram network with infinite storage, first-in-first-out queuing, at least two packet switches, and a finite packet lifetime will, under overload, drop all packets. By attacking the problem of congestion for the infinite-storage case, new solutions applicable to switches with finite storage may be found. No proposed solutions this document are intended as standards for the ARPA-Internet at this time.},

The protocol modifies the linear window growth function of existing TCP standards to be a cubic function in order to improve the scalability of TCP over fast and long distance networks. It also achieves more equitable bandwidth allocations among flows with different RTTs (round trip times) by making the window growth to be independent of RTT -- thus those flows grow their congestion window at the same rate. During steady state, CUBIC increases the window size aggressively when the window is far from the saturation point, and the slowly when it is close to the saturation point. This feature allows CUBIC to be very scalable when the bandwidth and delay product of the network is large, and at the same time, be highly stable and also fair to standard TCP flows. The implementation of CUBIC in Linux has gone through several upgrades. This paper documents its design, implementation, performance and evolution as the default TCP algorithm of Linux.},

Delay-based TCP CC algorithms infer congestion from delay measurements and tend to keep queue lengths low.

We propose and implement a delay-gradient CC algorithm (CDG) that no longer requires knowledge of path-speciﬁc minimum RTT or delay thresholds. Our FreeBSD implementation is shown to coexist reasonably with loss-based TCP (NewReno) in lightly multiplexed environments, share capacity fairly between instances of itself and NewReno, and exhibits improved tolerance of non-congestion related losses (86 \% better goodput than NewReno in the presence of 1 \% packet losses).},

In this paper we design an AQM mechanism (Learning Fair Qdisc (LFQ)) that dynamically learns the optimal buffer size for each flow according to a specified reward function online. We show that our Deep Learning based algorithm can dynamically assign the optimal queue size to each flow depending on its congestion control, delay and bandwidth.

Instead of using packet loss as congestion signal, like many currently used congestion controls, it uses an estimate of the available bottleneck link bandwidth to determine its sending rate. BBR tries to provide high link utilization while avoiding to create queues in bottleneck buffers. The original publication of BBR shows that it can deliver superior performance compared to Cubic TCP in some environments. This paper provides an independent and extensive experimental evaluation of BBR at higher speeds. The experimental setup uses BBR's Linux kernel 4.9 implementation and typical data rates of 10Gbit/s and 1 Gbit/s at the bottleneck link. The experiments vary the flows' round-trip times, the number of flows, and buffer sizes at the bottleneck. The evaluation considers throughput, queuing delay, packet loss, and fairness. On the one hand, the intended behavior of BBR could be observed with our experiments. On the other hand, some severe inherent issues such as increased queuing delays, unfairness, and massive packet loss were also detected. The paper provides an in-depth discussion of BBR's behavior in different experiment setups.},
